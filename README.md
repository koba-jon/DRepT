## 1. Overview

### (1) Abstract
The purpose is to improve the accuracy of anomaly detection for the target domain in surface anomaly detection (i.e., defect detection).<br>
DRepT uses an anomaly image in the source domain and transfers its defect representation to a normal image in the target domain.<br>
As a result, an anomaly image for the target domain is generated with high quality, and these anomaly images can be used for training the anomaly detection model.

### (2) Data available for training
Source domain: Normal images and Anomaly images (without Ground Truth) <br>
Target domain: Normal images only <br>

## 2. Preparation

### (1) Requirement

```
$ pip3 install torch torchvision numpy pillow tqdm tb-nightly future natsort opencv-python
```

### (2) Git clone
```
$ git clone https://github.com/koba-jon/DRepT.git
$ cd DRepT
```

### (3) Set dataset

Example of [MVTecAD](https://www.mvtec.com/company/research/datasets/mvtec-ad)[2]: <br>
```
$ ln -s <mvtec_anomaly_detection_dataset_path> ./datasets/mvtec_anomaly_detection
$ bash datasets/MVTecAD_convert.sh
```

![experiments-flow](scripts/experiment.png)

### (A) Train and save the stage 1 networks

```
$ bash scripts/MVTecAD/A_stage1/carpet.sh
$ bash scripts/MVTecAD/A_stage1/tile.sh
$ bash scripts/MVTecAD/A_stage1/wood.sh
```

### (B) Train and save the GMMs with the stage 1 networks

```
$ bash scripts/MVTecAD/B_stage2/carpet.sh
$ bash scripts/MVTecAD/B_stage2/tile.sh
$ bash scripts/MVTecAD/B_stage2/wood.sh
```

### (C) Copy the GMMs as the models of source domain

```
$ bash scripts/MVTecAD/C_set/leather.sh
```

### (D) Train and save the stage 3 network

```
$ bash scripts/MVTecAD/D_stage3/leather.sh
```

### (E) Calculate AUROC with the stage 3 networks

```
$ bash scripts/MVTecAD/E_test/leather.sh
```

### (X) Transfer the defect representation (GMM) from source to target domain

Example of "Carpet to Leather":
```
$ bash scripts/MVTecAD/X_transfer/22.sh
```
